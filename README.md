# JetBot

This repository contains my implementation of an AI-powered robotic system using NVIDIA's Jetson Nano Processor, and Jetbot. The project was developed during my summer research internship at IIT Guwahati under the IAS-INSA-NASI FAST Summer Research Fellowship Program. The primary objective was to implement object detection and following functionalities on the JetBot using the NVIDIA Jetson Nano processor.

## Project Overview

- **Platform**: NVIDIA JetBot powered by Jetson Nano
- **Objective**: Implement object detection and following capabilities along with road following and collision avoidance
- **Duration**: 2 months
- **Institution**: IIT Guwahati
- **Mentor**: Dr. Partha Sarathi Mandal

## Features Implemented

- **Object Detection**: Utilized pre-trained models to detect and classify objects in real-time.
- **Object Following**: Enabled the JetBot to follow a detected object, maintaining a safe distance.
- **Collision Avoidance**: Integrated sensors and algorithms to prevent collisions with obstacles.
- **Teleoperation**: Implemented remote control capabilities using a web interface.
- **Battery Monitoring**: Developed scripts to monitor and report battery voltage levels.
